# 📁 Week 5 Assignment – Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This assignment explores key concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Python. It includes real-world examples like superheroes and vehicles to demonstrate how OOP models systems using:

- ✅ Classes & Objects
- ✅ Attributes & Methods
- ✅ Constructors (`__init__`)
- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Polymorphism

---

## 📄 Files Included

- **`superhero.py`**  
  Defines a `Superhero` class and a subclass `FlyingSuperhero`, demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism by customizing the `save_the_day()` method and adding `fly()`.

- **`vehicles_polymorphism.py`**  
  Includes a parent class `Vehicle` and multiple subclasses like `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`. Each subclass overrides the `move()` method to show **polymorphism** in action.
